    Use an image segmentation to produce a RGB+D image (image + depthmap). Or use the GUI to view already-made RGB+D images in 3D, there's even an anaglyph mode to perceive depth with red+cyan glasses. Animate the 3D view and export to a series of images to build later an animated image. This nice GUI uses QT, OpenCV and OpenGL.
