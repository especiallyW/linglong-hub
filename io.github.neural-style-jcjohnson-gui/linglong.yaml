    neural-style is a stunning piece of code, which can apply a style (e.g. Picasso, Van Gogh, whatever you choose) to your photos. For that, it uses A.I., more precisely convolutional neural networks. An implementation of neural style with Torch by jcjohnson: https://github.com/jcjohnson/neural-style.
